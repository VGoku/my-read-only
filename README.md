🌀 Quantum Toaster 3000 🍞
Making Schrödinger’s Breakfast a Reality.

📦 Project Overview
Welcome to the Quantum Toaster 3000 — the world's first breakfast appliance that operates on the edge of classical and quantum physics. Finally, you can toast bread and collapse probability wavefunctions at the same time.

Whether you want your toast lightly crisped or existentially questioned, QT3000 has your back (and your breakfast).

⚙️ Features
🔬 Quantum Crisping – Utilizes entangled heat elements to deliver evenly distributed browning across all universes.

🧠 AI Taste Syncing – Syncs with your mood via EEG headband (sold separately) to determine your ideal level of toastiness.

🪐 Multiverse Mode – Toasts every possible bread type in alternate realities. Choose from a variety of quantum timelines.

🥶 Undo Burn – Reverse time (briefly) to save your toast from catastrophic overheat events.

🚀 Installation
bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/QuantumBreakfast/Toaster3000.git
cd Toaster3000
make breakfast
Note: May require a Hadron Collider or IKEA screwdriver.

🛠️ Usage
Insert bread (or equivalent 2D carbohydrate matrix).

Select reality: ./qt3000 --timeline "fluffy-future"

Wait for quantum toastification.

Enjoy. Or don’t. The toaster doesn’t care. It exists beyond emotion.

🧪 Known Issues
Occasionally opens portals.

Butter application not yet entangled with jam spreader.

Toast may scream softly in some dimensions. This is expected.
